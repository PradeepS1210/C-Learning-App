# Project Title: C++ Learning App

# Overview:

This repository contains the source code for a C++ Learning App, designed to facilitate self-paced learning of C++ programming concepts. The app provides functionalities for user registration, course enrollment, chapter-wise learning, quizzes, and score tracking.

# Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can register with unique usernames and passwords or login if already registered.
Course Enrollment: Users can enroll in available courses such as "C++ Programming" and "Java Programming".
Chapter-wise Learning: Enrolled users can select chapters from their enrolled courses and access detailed chapter definitions.
Quizzes: Each chapter includes a quiz with multiple-choice questions to assess understanding.
Score Tracking: The app tracks user scores across quizzes and displays total scores.

# Technologies Used:

C++ programming language
Standard Template Library (STL)
File I/O for user data persistence
Basic console-based user interface

# Project Structure:

main.cpp: Contains the main program logic including user authentication, course enrollment, chapter selection, quiz handling, and user interface.
user_data.txt: Text file for storing user data such as usernames, passwords, and scores.
Conio.h: Header file for console input/output functions.

# How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable file generated after compilation.
Register as a new user or login with existing credentials.
Enroll in available courses and start learning chapters.
Take quizzes to assess your understanding and track your scores.

# Note:

This project is a minor project developed for educational purposes and demonstrates basic concepts of C++ programming, file handling, and user interaction.
